        Getting Started
        </h1>
        <p>
            TableViews library generates tables and individual cells that developers can move to act like tables.
            Cells can act as textboxes, where developers can input bodies of text to display to users.
            Cells can also act as quizzes, where each cell is assigned a true or false value. 
            Each cell can also be an input field, where developers can receive user input.
            There are also rating cells (users can submit up to five hearts) and selection cells (users can select one choice to be submitted). 
            Cells are completely customizable by developers, and developers can exercise their creative freedom by setting the position, 
            height and size of cells and tables to suit their website needs. 
            When working with tables, first set the width and length, as well as choose the cell theme.
            Developers only need to input the number of rows and columns, along with the position of the table and the library will generate a table 
            contained within the allocated space. 
            Each cell within the table is customizable in its color, inner text and type (text, input, quiz, rating, selection). 
            Developers only need to specify the row, column, table and change for the cell to be edited. 
            
            <br></br>

            To get started, call the scripts below in your code;
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                &ltscript defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"&gt &lt/script&gt
                &ltscript defer type="text/javascript" src='tableViews.js'&gt &lt/script&gt
                &ltscript defer type="text/javascript" src='your-js-file.js'&gt &lt/script&gt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            A code snippet of a basic cell and table are shown below;
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const cells = new TableCellGenerator()  //making cells
                const tables = new TableGenerator()     //making tables

                const texts = [['Cell0', 'Cell1'], ['Cell2', 'Cell3'], ['Cell4', 'Cell5']]  //these will be what the cells in the table displays
                cells.makeCell('300px', '80px', '100px', '100px', 'TableViews', false)  // a cell has been created with the word TableViews. 
                                                                                        //To make the TableViews cell draggable, change false to true
                
                tables.setSizeTheme('500', '300', false)   //this sets the sizing theme of tables. To change to a table with small cells, change false to true.
                tables.makeTable(3, 2, '300px', '100px', true, 't', texts)  //this makes a table with the texts array displayed in each cell. 
                //To change the type of the cell, change 't' to another one below;

                //S - selection
                //I - input
                //B - quiz
                //H - rating
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            See the API section below for a in-depth explaination of the library and customizations avaliable.
        </p>

        <h1>API</h1>

        <p>
            To create cell and table objects, first call the respective generators, shown below;
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const cells = new TableCellGenerator()  //making cells
                const tables = new TableGenerator()     //making tables
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            To make a table or cell, call the makeTable or makeCell function, shown below;
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                cells.makeCell(cell_width, cell_height, cell_margin_top, cell_margin_left, optional_cell_inner_text, isDraggable)
                
                tables.setSizeTheme(table_width, table_height, haveSmallCells) //remember to set the sizing theme of the tables
                tables.makeTable(row_number, column_number, margin_top, margin_left, isDraggable, cell_type, cell_inner_texts array)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Just replace each of the variable calls in the method calls (like cell_width) and the tables will be added to your website! Note: all cell and table number starts from 0.
        </p>

        <h3>Cells</h3>
        <p>
            By calling TableCellGenerator, many cells can be generated. Every TableCellGenerator object will contain a list of cells that it has generated.
            Developers can access styling and customization of these cells by keeping track of the the number in which they were generated and then calling 
            the necessary methods. 
            <br></br> 
            In each method of creating cells, the methods takes in;
            <br></br> 
            width, type String, which is the width of the cell in px.<br></br> 
            height, type String, which is the height of the cell in px.<br></br> 
            top, type String, which is the margin-top of the cell in px.<br></br> 
            left, type String, which is the margin-left of the cell in px.<br></br> 
            drag, type boolean, which will be elaborated more in the Customization section. <br></br> <br></br> 
            Users will see all the cells that each TableCellGenerator creates. Below are the six different types of cells that developers can choose from;
            <br></br> 
            Selection Cells: Created by the method makeSelectionCells(width, height, top, left, array, draggable). The array a list of strings that sets
            the list of options that 
            users will be able to select from. Users will be able to click the cell and a drop-down will show the user all the different avaliable selections.
            <br></br> 
            Quiz Cells: Created by the method makeQuizCells(width, height, top, left, text, value). Text (type String) is the text that the quiz button will display. 
            Value is the truth value of the button (type boolean), which will display the result to the user accordingly. 
            <br></br> 
            Header Cells: Created by makeHeaderCell(width, height, top, left, words). Words (type String) are the text that are displayed in the cell.
            <br></br> 
            User Input Cells: Created by addUserInput(width, height, top, left, drag). This creates a form where users can type in. By clicking the attached submit button, 
            users will be able to send their response to the developer. Currently, user input is displayed in the console. 
            <br></br> 
            Text Cells: Created by makeCell(width, height, top, left, words, drag). Words (type String) are the text that are displayed in the cell. This is different from header cells as 
            header cells cannot be dragged. The displayed words are also different visually. Developers can pick the style that best suits their needs. 
            <br></br> 
            Rating Cells: Created by makeHeartsCell(width, height, top, left, drag). Three hearts are displayed in a cell, so users can give a rating out of three. 
            To send a rating, users can click the empty hearts and watch it change color to confirm their selection. Each heart has a rating value, which is returned and 
            can then be viewed by the developer. Currently the rating will be outputted in the console. 
            <br></br> 
        </p>

        <h3>Tables</h3>
        <p>
            Developers can put each of the six types of cells into a table for further usability. Tables are made from calling the TableGenerator() method to create a tables object. 
            (seen in the introductory code). The TableGenerator object will hold a list of tables, which the developer can keep track of to customize (more in the Customization section).
            Developers also need the table number in relation to the object (as in the first table the TableGenerator object created, the second and so on) to edit the table.
            To make a table, developers must set the sizing theme of the inside cells first.
            This is done by calling the setSizeTheme(...) method, which will be elaborted upon in the Customization section. After setting the cells theme of the table, developers
            can create a table by calling the makeTable(...) method multiple times to create tables with the same cell sizing theme. 
            Developers can edit already created tables by adding and deleting rows and columns, and adding header rows. 
            <br></br> 
            Below are the value types of each of the varables used in table manipulation methods and their explaination;
            <br></br> 
            row_number: Type int. This is the row number of a table. Each table has an array of rows that contain cells, which start numbering at 0.
            <br></br> 
            column_number: Type int. This is the column number of a table. Similarily, the column number starts at 0 for each table.
            <br></br> 
            number_of_rows: Type int. This is the number of rows desired when creating a table. This number is always greater than 0.
            <br></br> 
            number_of_columns: Type int. This is the number of columns desired when creating a table. This number is always greater than 0.
            <br></br> 
            top: Type String. This is the margin-top of the table.
            <br></br> 
            left: Type String. This is the margin-left of the table.
            <br></br> 
            drag: Type boolean. Allow the user to drag the table. For further explaination, see Customization section.
            <br></br> 
            type: Type String. To set the types of cells in a table, developers must pass a string (case is irrelevant) that corresponds to a cell type.
            <br></br>
            S for selection, I for user input, B for quiz, H for rating and T for text. Headers are created seperately. 
            <br></br> 
            option1: Type array. This is an array of the associated arguments for the cell types. It should be an array corresponding to the third last argument
            in the method calls to make individual cells. The values should be written in the format of the rowxcolumn. 
            <br></br> 
            option2: Type array. This is an array of boolean values and should only be used when making a table, column and/or row of quiz cells. The values should be written in the format of the rowxcolumn. 
            <br></br> 
            table: Type int. This is the table number, found by the order of tables created by TableGenerator object. 
            
            <br></br> 
            Below are the methods and explainations for table creating and editing;
            <br></br> 
            makeTable(number_of_row, number_of_column, top, left, drag, type, option1, option2): This method creates a table that is added to the TableGenerator tables list.
            <br></br> 
            addTableRow(table, row_number, type, option1, option2): This method adds a row to the table. row_number refers to the position in the table that the developer wishes for the 
            new row to take. 
            <br></br> 
            addColumn(table, column_number, type, option1, option2): This method adds a column to the table. column_number refers to the position in the table that the developer
            wishes for the new column to take.
            <br></br> 
            removeTableRow(table, row_number): This method removes a row from the table. row_number refers to the row number that the developer wishes to remove. 
            <br></br> 
            removeTableColumn(table, column_number): This method removes a column from the table. column_number refers to the column number that the developer wishes to remove.
            <br></br> 
            addTableHeaderfunction(table, type): The method adds a header that is sticky to the top of the table. This will be the first row, ie. row number 0. If the deverloper
            wishes to have the table seperated by sections, simply add another row to position 0. 
            <br></br> 

        </p>

        <h3>Customization: Methods and Variables</h3>
        <p>
            drag: Type boolean   
            <br></br> 
            Introduced in the Cells section, by sending a truth value as an argument at the end of creating cells or tables will allow users 
            to interact with the object by clicking on it and moving it around the page. This would be useful 
            if a table or is needed at multiple points in the page. Developers can set the value to true, allowing users to interact, 
            or false to prevent them from interacting. Header and Quiz cells will always be undraggable.
            <br></br>
            The default value is false. This value does not apply to the cells within a table, only on the table itself or cells outside of tables.
            <br></br>
            setSizeTheme(width, height, haveSmallCells):
            <br></br> 
            Shown in the beginning code snippet, developers can set the size of the table by calling the setSizeTheme() method. This only works with a table generator. 
            The arguments includes the desired table width (type int), height (type int), and if the table has comparably small cells or not (type boolean. 
            If the developer wishes for the small cells theme, they can set the value as true, and false to use the large cells theme. 
            <br></br>
            Without calling setSizeTheme, no sizing will be used on the table, and the size will be to fit based on the inner cells and their text size. 
            This value does not apply to the cells within a table, only on the table itself.
            <br></br>
            changeColor(...):
            <br></br> 
            Developers can change the color of entire tables, individual rows, columns and individual cells (within and outside of tables). 
            The methods are explained below;
            <br></br> 
            cells.changeCellsColor(color, cell): this method takes in the color (type String) to change to and the cell number (type int) according to the TableCellGenerator object.  
            <br></br> 
            tables.changeTableColor(color, table): this method takes in the color (type String) to change to and the table number (type int) according to the TableGenerator object.
            <br></br> 
            tables.changeRowColor(color, table, row): besides the color (type String) and table number, this method takes in the row number (type int) of the selected table. 
            <br></br> 
            tables.changeColumnColor(color, table, column): besides the color (type String) and table number (type int), this method also takes in the column number (type int) of the selected table.
            <br></br> 
            tables.changeTableCellColor(color, table, row, column): this table takes in the desired color (type String), table number (type int), the row and column number (type int) of the table to get the specified cell.
